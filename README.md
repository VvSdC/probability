# Introduction to Probability

It is about determining the likelihood of an event or experiment. <br>

Example : 
- Tossing a coin. <br>
  Sample space/ Total number of possible outcomes = 2 {Head,Tail}<br>
  Number of favourable outcomes of obtaining head = 1 {Head} <br>
  Probability of obtaining head= Pr(Head) =Number of favourable outcomes/total outcomes = 1/2 <br>
  Probability of obtaining tail = Pr(Tail) = 1/2 <br>
- Rolling a fair dice <br>
  Sample space (Total number of outcomes)  = 6 {1,2,3,4,5,6} <br>
  Favourable outcomes for getting 1 = 1 {1} <br>
  Probability of obtaining 1 = Pr(1) = Favourable outcomes/Total outcomes = 1/6 <br>

# Addition rule

It differs for mutually exlusive and non mutually exlusive events.
- [Mutual exclusive events](#mutual-exclusive-events)
- [Addition rule for mutually exclusive events](#addition-rule-for-mutually-exclusive-events)
- [Addition rules for non mutually exclusive events](#addition-rule-for-non-mutually-exclusive-events)

### Mutual exclusive events
Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.<br>

Example for mutually exlusive events: 
- Tossing a coin <br>
  We will not get head and tail at the same time when toss is coined once. So, tossing a coin is mutually exclusive event.
- Rolling a fair dice <br>
  When a fair dice is rolled, we can only get one number at a time. So, rolling a dice is a mutually exclusive event.

### Addition rule for mutually exclusive events

For two mutual exlsuive events X and Y, the Probability of obtaining X or Y is

# Multiplication rule

- [Independent events](#independent-events)
- [Dependent events](#dependent-events)


### Independent events

Two events are independent if they donot effect each other. <br>
If X and Y are independent events, then probability of occuring of X and then Y is <br>

### Dependent events

Two events are dependent if they effect each other. <br>
If X and Y are dependent events, then probability of occcuring of X first and then Y is <br>
