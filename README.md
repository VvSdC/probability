# Introduction to Probability

It is about determining the likelihood of an event or experiment. <br>

Example : 
- Tossing a coin. <br>
  Sample space/ Total number of possible outcomes = 2 {Head,Tail}<br>
  Number of favourable outcomes of obtaining head = 1 {Head} <br>
  Probability of obtaining head= Pr(Head) =Number of favourable outcomes/total outcomes = 1/2 <br>
  Probability of obtaining tail = Pr(Tail) = 1/2 <br>
- Rolling a fair dice <br>
  Sample space (Total number of outcomes)  = 6 {1,2,3,4,5,6} <br>
  Favourable outcomes for getting 1 = 1 {1} <br>
  Probability of obtaining 1 = Pr(1) = Favourable outcomes/Total outcomes = 1/6 <br>
