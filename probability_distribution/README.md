# Probability Distribution Function

Probability distribution function describes how the probabilities are distributed over the values of a random variable. <br>

# Probability Mass Function

It is used for discrete random variable. <br>

Example : Rolling a fair dice => Pr(1) = Pr(2) = Pr(3) = Pr(4) = Pr(5) = Pr(6) = 1/6 <br>

# Probability Density Function 

It is used for continuous random variables. <br>

**Probability density is the slope of cumulative probability curve**. So, if the slope of cumulative probability curve is more, the value of probability density will be more as well. <br>

<br>

**So, we can define probability density as graident descent of cumulative density function.**<br>

Characteristics of Probability Density Function : 
- It is always non-negative
- The total area under the Probability density function curve is equal to 1.
